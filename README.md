A steering wheel can control RC car remotely, but it won't be just a boring steering wheel. Time go through. Techoology today has been high enough to make car do a lot of amazing things. This project will integrate several famous module in markets. And make a wonderful song no one ever heard in maker's world.
During these days, an interesting solution of wifi is poping up in the makers' world. It's ESP8266 module. This module use IEEE
802.11 Protcol as known as wifi. It carry a flash memory on, so developer can upload new firware or write code like Aduino.
It's also an Wifi-mcu, cpable of doing some simple I/O.

One part of this project is based on this tiny but strong communication module.
